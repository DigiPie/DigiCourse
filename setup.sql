We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree"s were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn"t a place to miss.

We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn"t make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn"t because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be "picky" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.');

I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can"t make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad"s key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said "Sorry we Missed you"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn"t put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren"t for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn"t get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.');

Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don"t even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can"t afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again.');

Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of "I"m sorry!"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don"t. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store.');

Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn"t care, it"s a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger)');

The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can"t wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results.

The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn"t apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn"t charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price.

They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn"t order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn"t want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like.

On the day they were suppose to come out, about an hour before our scheduled time, Mary texted and told me her husband had a flat tire and that they"d be late. I told her, no problem. I was ok. Then......SILENCE. Never heard back from her again. I texted a few more times to reschedule, I asked her if everything was alright, I even asked if they were OK?

They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap.

My wife received a borage of "I"m sorry!"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don"t. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo.

I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn"t make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must"ve answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say "hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!" Much more personal.');

He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  "begged" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying "I"m not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI." Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart. Dr Dana Seltzer. The surgery WAS difficult and the rehab WAS difficult, but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact.');

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert"s movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there"s just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12" x 12" square and 10-12" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8" square base, next layer 6" base and the top layer 4" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. It"s very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn"t change anything. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake.');

A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn"t know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I"m not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn"t even say, "Thank you," It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I"m in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she"s in the shop because she"s so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it"s the economy, that"s one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly.');

I highly recommend this place if you"re in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I"m usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they"re supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!');

So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn"t yellow and doesn"t taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don"t want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it.

I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did.

Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.

Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn"t need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would"ve expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn"t even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won"t return. If I"m paying this much, I"d like to feel a little more pampered.');

On the day of the surgery, I appreciated that bit of professional distance that he kept and felt comfortable in his hands and under his care.)  He and his staff were great about working with my crazy schedule and finding times that would work for me. Everything was very upfront. There were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs. Dr. Malek customized the procedure to obtain the best results for my particular situation and explained to me in detail what he suggested and why he felt it was the best approach. The results are incrdible. (I"ve used the word magician quite a few times when speaking about Dr. Malek"s skill.)

I did & he didn"t even check me (didn"t undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn"t seem to care about my well being and didn"t care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus.
